## CODTECH_task-1_File-Handling-Utility

## Project Description: File Handling Utility in Java
This project, titled "File Handling Utility", is an internship task assigned by CODTECH. The objective of this task is to develop a Java-based program that demonstrates fundamental file operations, including reading, writing, and modifying text files. The deliverable includes a well-structured Java script with clear documentation to illustrate file handling functionalities effectively.

## Overview of the Workflow in IntelliJ IDEA
The development of this project was carried out in IntelliJ IDEA, a widely used Java IDE that provides powerful coding and debugging tools. The workflow followed in implementing the File Handling Utility can be broken down into several key stages:

# 1. Setting Up the Project

Step 1: Opened IntelliJ IDEA and created a new Java project.
Step 2: Defined a new Java class named FileHandlingUtility.java and configured the environment to run the script.

# 2. Writing the Java Program

The FileHandlingUtility program performs three key operations on a text file:

Writing Data to a File
Reading Data from a File
Modifying the File Content

# 2.1 Writing Data to the File

The writeFile() method was implemented using BufferedWriter to write a predefined text into the file named sample.txt. The content written was:

```
Hello, this is a sample text file.
This file will demonstrate file handling in Java.
```
The method works as follows:

   A BufferedWriter object is created using FileWriter(FILE_PATH).
   The specified content is written to the file.
   The file stream is closed automatically due to the try-with-resources block.
   ```
public static void writeFile(String content) throws IOException {
    try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(FILE_PATH))) {
        writer.write(content);
    }
}
```
## 2.2 Reading Data from the File
The readFile() method was implemented to read and display the fileâ€™s content using BufferedReader. The method:

Opens the file for reading.
Reads the file line by line using a while loop.
Prints each line to the console.
```
public static void readFile() throws IOException {
    try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(FILE_PATH))) {
        String line;
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            System.out.println(line);
        }
    }
}
```
## Console Output:
```
File Content:
Hello, this is a sample text file.
This file will demonstrate file handling in Java.
```
## 2.3 Modifying the File Content
The modifyFile() method was implemented to replace a specific word in the file content. In this case, the word "sample" was replaced with "example". This was achieved by:

Reading all lines from the file using Files.readAllLines(path).
Iterating over the lines and replacing the target word.
Writing the modified content back to the file using Files.write(path, modifiedLines).
```

public static void modifyFile(String target, String replacement) throws IOException {
    Path path = Paths.get(FILE_PATH);
    List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(path);

    List<String> modifiedLines = new ArrayList<>();
    for (String line : lines) {
        modifiedLines.add(line.replace(target, replacement));
    }

    Files.write(path, modifiedLines);
}
```
# 3. Execution and Output
After implementing the functions, the main method was used to:

     1.Write the original content to the file.
     2.Read and display the file content.
     3.Modify the file by replacing "sample" with "example."
     4.Read and display the modified content.
     
# Execution Output in IntelliJ IDEA
The execution output from IntelliJ IDEA confirms that the operations were performed correctly:

![task1output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/341fe87b-dd7e-4437-b774-876b9982d22c)


   Before modification: The file contained "Hello, this is a sample text file."
   After modification: The word "sample" was changed to "example" in "Hello, this is a example 
   text file."

## 4. Summary of the Work Done in IntelliJ IDEA
Created a new Java project in IntelliJ IDEA.
Implemented file operations (writing, reading, modifying).
Ran the program and verified the outputs.
Used IntelliJ's built-in terminal to execute and debug the Java code.
Displayed console logs confirming successful execution.

## Conclusion
The File Handling Utility program successfully demonstrates essential file operations in Java. It efficiently performs writing, reading, and modifying text files while ensuring code readability and maintainability. The structured approach taken in IntelliJ IDEA facilitated a seamless development and testing process. This project serves as a fundamental example of handling files in Java and provides a solid foundation for more advanced file-processing applications.
